## Nayara Andressa
Electrical Engineering student from Jaragu√° do Sul - SC, Brazil. I had my first contact with HTML and CSS editing my Tumblr page by myself when I was a pre teen. Throghout my career, I also learned a lot of different industrial programming languages, which made me fall in love for programming again and led me to want to improve my skills.
